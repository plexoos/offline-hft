This are macros that I used to generatt the ideal PXL sector geometry.
The structures are rather complicated, so it was the easiest to generate the geometry 
from the underlying formulae that Howard Weiman has described in great detail.

This was then used to define using the root TGeo classes, so geometry could be reviwed as it was developed.
STAR does not use TGeo directly, but rather the general AGML such that both
Geant3 and Root VMC can be created from the same base set of files.
The Agml imposes som e stringent order in which tree structures has to be defined and positioned.
I did not implement this completely, but the macros are able to generate the skeleton agml xml code,
that was then imported by Jonathan into the Pixel geometry.

The macro Sector.C has all the calculational stuff, that generates a number of files (either .C or .xml). 
It also has numerous testing routines, as well as functions, that generates geant code based on shapes, (BOX, TUBS,...).
the macro assembly.C reads the generated .C files and make an assembly of beamPipe + pixel sectors.
The macro will also generate the radiation lenght budget.

the run.C macro executes this chain.

The trap.C is an assembly testing the generation of trapziods based on defining the 4 points
of the corner.
